        <p class="story-node-name">Her plan</p>
        <div class="story-node-text">
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“There is a woman who comes in here twice a day to give us food,” she explains. “She is always escorted by at least two other men in case any of us attempt to put up a fight. I think she’s been hinting at a way for us to escape. I see it in her eyes that she pities us being here.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“What hints?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“She taps her foot every time before she enters the room as if she was clearing the dust off her shoes. Left-left-right-right-left. I think it’s a sign.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“How sure are you that it isn’t some kind of coincidence?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“I just <em>know</em>.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“Then, why haven’t you escaped yet?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">Her shoulders visibly droop and her voice comes in whisper. “I did.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You reel as though you’ve been slapped. “What? What happened?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“It was a stroke of immense luck. They were careless one day and forgot to lock the door, so when I tried, I could leave. And I ran. I didn’t know about the instructions then, so I just ran. There was a soldier along the way. I mean he was wearing a uniform and he seemed so nice and I thought <em>I made it...</em>“</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“But he wasn’t who you thought he was…” You touch her hand and she winces. You gently pick up her hand, but she shakes her head and pulls back.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“He made me come back here and they brutalised me to teach me a lesson.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You take a hard look at her face and see that underneath the curtain of her hair, there were still purple brusies sticking out. And they way she way she gently cradled her hand and the odd angle her foot was in, it must have been broken. “So why are you telling me this if it didn’t work?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“Because I <em>believe</em> in my heart of hearts that it will. I just no longer have the physical capacity to escape.” You look into her eyes as she tells you and it is hysterical, desperate and immensely sad.</p>
