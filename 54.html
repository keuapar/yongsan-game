            <p class="story-node-text-p">You continue walking down the street. It is beautifully lined with trees shedding their leaves in preparation of the winter. You get lost in its beauty and follow the road, but even though it is dark, you see a man painting on canvas at the side of the street. He has two large suitcases next to him and cardboard box of miscellaneous items.</p>

            <p class="story-node-text-p">He notices you coming up to him and asks you “Would you like to be a part of the painting?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“What are you painting for?” you counter.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“My final memories of Samgakji. I’m leaving it and I don’t know when I will come back,” he looks at you sadly. “I got evicted today after I couldn’t pay the rent anymore. Being an artist doesn’t pay when there aren’t enough people to pay for your art.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“I’m sorry to hear,” you tell him “But why do you want me in the painting? I’m not even from here.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“I liked the way you were looking around before, as if you really appreciated the scene around you which is exactly the feeling I am capturing here.</p>
