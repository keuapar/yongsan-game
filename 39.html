            <p class="story-node-text-p">You look underneath the haphazard pile of papers - no key.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You check in the drawers - no key.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You check between the cushions of the chair - no key.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">There has to be a key somewhere. You sit on the floor and try to think about another means of escape.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">Then, the gleam of metal catches your eye. You look underneath the desk and YES. There is a key hanging on a hook. You take it. There is no time to lose, you rush out the door and find yourself in a tight alley. You follow the alley until you reach an intersection.</p>

            <p class="story-node-text-p">It seems like the night is winding down. The remaining drunkards are stumbling back home underneath the neon glow of bar signs that are starting to switch off. Some with a girl on their arm, some grasping at the air. Broken bottles litter the ground and the smell of alcohol and cigarettes lingers in the air. The broken glass on the floor gives you a good opportunity to cut off the zipties from your wrists.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You rub your wrists, you never realised how much you relied on having free movement of your hands.</p>
