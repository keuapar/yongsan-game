            <p class="story-node-text-p">The lady sets the pot down in front of you and brings you a bowl of rice. Your stomach growls at the sight of the food. She brings out side dishes for you and pours you a cup of water.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“Eat,” she gestures.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">The flavour is deep and rich with a variety of interesting flavours. It makes you smile, how much it reminds you of home - a little seaside village on the southern corner of South Korea.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“There are a fair number of girls like you who have been passing through here. I have a contact who provides food for you and she’s been giving signals about how to get here.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“Why can’t we just go to the police?” you ask between spoonfuls of food. “Why go through the hassle and risk?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">She points to a picture frame on the wall. It was taken professionally against a backdrop, a couple smiling widely and showing off their rings. “My husband had the same idea. We took that picture in a small photo studio that my husband used to own. We sold it to someone else to open this restaurant.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“What happened?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“He started poking around in all the wrong places when he noticed there was something strange going on. He started asking about the girls he was seeing around these parts, too young to be hanging of the arms of men, their eyes too vacant for this life to seem like a choice. He made the mistake of approaching one of the girls directly and pressing too hard for questions. A few bigger men showed up and told him to back off, and he threatened to report it. They warned him. He came home furious and stubborn that he had to do something about it. I tried to tell him to think about it, but he left to report it, and I never saw him again. Instead, my husband has been replaced by these goons watching me.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“I’m so sorry,” you say unsure of how to comfort her. After a moment, she recomposes herself and you ask, “So why do you still want to help me?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“My husband can’t have died for nothing now, can he?” she says with a small smile.</p>
