            <p class="story-node-text-p">As you struggle to figure out what to say to her, she walks towards you and tugs on your arm. “Follow me, then,” she says.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">She seems fairly harmless, so you decide to just go along with it. She crosses the street and walks towards a bunch of warehouses behind a barbed wire fence. She walks along the length of the barbed wire fence that doesn’t face the main road and stops at a spot to pull at the fence. That spot opens easily and she ducks inside. She holds it open for you, and you follow her in all the way to a warehouse in the corner.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“Are you a customer or new recruit?” she asks once, you’ve both entered the warehouse and shuts the door behind you.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You look at her quizzically. “I don’t quite understand.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“Hmm… Alright then, how can I help you?” She sits down on a couch pockmarked with cigarette burns and puts her feet up on a coffee table.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“I think I need help. I am possibly in big trouble,” you start hesitantly.</p>
