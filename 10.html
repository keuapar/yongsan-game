            <p class="story-node-text-p">“I don’t know… I’m afraid…” you say tentatively.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“To end up like me? Don’t worry. I won’t make you leave. But you know it was good out there while it lasted,” a nostalgic feeling crosses over her face. “When I left here, I just ran straight all the way, hoping that someone would save me.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“I was running past a few factories and distinctly remember the smell of chocolate, so sweet and tempting, before I was caught,” she fades into silence for a moment. “And art, colourful art. It reminded me of home. You know my father is an artist and he always used to say that he wanted to come to Samgakji.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You take a guess that she means that’s where we are at. “Why come here?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“Because of Park Soo-Geun. His pieces are so original, I have never seen texture like that before on a painting. And he started right here painting portraits for soldiers and making copies of famous paintings. My father drew the most life-like portraits, as if they were moments from moving, but it felt too much like an imitation than the novel spin Park Soo-Geun put on his works. I wonder if my father is painting right now…” Her eyes become vacant, sadness welling them up.</p>
