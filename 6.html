            <p class="story-node-text-p">You decide to wake the girl closest to you. <em>Please be nice,</em> you hope. You gently shake her shoulder as she rouses awake.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">She jolts awake and her eyes are wide with fear as she looks at you. Instantaneously, the fear is replaced by a guarded stare.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“Hello? Where are we? What is this place?”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">She gives you a sad smile as she says, “If you’re lucky, they’ll at least send you to a labour camp. Otherwise, you’re going to be warming a lot of men’s beds.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You feel like you can’t breathe. You figured you were in a bad place, but you were silently holding out hope that maybe it wasn’t as bad as it looked. You can’t seem to formulate a response, so you just sit there, shaking.</p>
