            <div class="med-back"><p>In 1960s, many artists gathered around Samgakji as the demand for ‘barbershop painting' boomed. The mass produced commercial paintings are exported to foreign markets, and artists earned money to open studios and shops. However, it did not last long as commercial arts in China and South East Asia were sold at lower prices. Exports of domestic art have declined sharply, most domestic export companies have closed, and many artists also lose their market and moved away.</p></div>
