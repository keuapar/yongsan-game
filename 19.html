            <p class="story-node-text-p">“I was just walking back home,” you explain to the soldier. Though after saying that, it probably seems more suspicious that you were trying to defend yourself. After all, there isn’t anything explicitly wrong with what you were doing.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">“It’s dangerous at night,” he replies ominously. “There have been a lot of rumours of dangerous activity going on around here recently. You should be careful.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You wonder if that was meant as a warning, but you decide to play it safe. “You should be careful too then,” you say mildly.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">A smile tugs at the corner of his mouth, twisting his face into something more sinister. “I’m a soldier. You’re just a girl. I think you should be careful. You say you live over there?” he gestures down the road.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">Discomfort creeps under your skin and you feel the strong urge to extricate yourself from the situation. “I really think I should get going.”</p>

            <p class="story-node-text-p">He grabs your arm. “You have the look of one of those girls you know. The stock that Kang Soo sells. He paid me well the last time I helped him collect his stock. Maybe I should do him a favour again.”</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">The thought sends a chill through your body and it seems as though he catches that. “If you girls keep running off like this, Kang Soo might have to start hiring me full time to catch you.”</p>
