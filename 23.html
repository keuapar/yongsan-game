            <p class="story-node-text-p">You try to play it cool and cross the street at the crossing. You can still feel him staring at you, but you keep your back straight and your face stoic. You try to project more confidence and strength than you feel.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">Now your path leads you to the first soldier. Great.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">You continue to walk in your faux confidence, hoping your knees don’t expose you by shaking. Your gaze is focused on a streetlight at the rotary. If I get to that streetlight, everything will be fine, you tell yourself.</p>
            <p class="story-node-text-p">But, your feet betray you and kick an uneven part of the sidewalk just as you’re walking past the soldier. He glances up from his cigarette and gives you a once over. You feel a blush creeping up your neck. You just keep walking, walking because if he is even half as suspicious as the last guy, you will be doomed.</p>
